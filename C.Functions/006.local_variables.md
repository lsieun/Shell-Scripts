# Local Variables

In the scripts we have written so far, all the variables (including constants) have been **global variables**. Global variables maintain their existence throughout the program. This is fine for many things, but it can sometimes complicate the use of shell functions.

Inside shell functions, it is often desirable to have **local variables**. Local variables are accessible only within the shell function in which they are defined and cease to exist once the shell function terminates.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# local-vars: script to demonstrate local variables

foo=0    # global variable foo

funct_1 () {
    local foo    # variable foo local to funct_1
    foo=1
    echo "funct_1: foo=$foo"
}

funct_2 () {
    local foo    # variable foo local to funct_2

    foo=2
    echo "funct_2: foo=$foo"
}

echo "global: foo = $foo"
funct_1
echo "global: foo = $foo"
funct_2
echo "global: foo = $foo"

```

As we can see, local variables are defined by preceding the variable name with the word `local`. This creates a variable that is local to the shell function in which it is defined. Once outside the shell function, the variable no longer exists.

When we run this script, we see these results:

```bash
$ local-vars
global: foo = 0
funct_1: foo=1
global: foo = 0
funct_2: foo=2
global: foo = 0
```
