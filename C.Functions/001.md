# Shell functions

Shell functions have two syntactic forms.

First, here is the more formal form:

```bash
function name {
    commands
    return
}
```

Here is the simpler (and generally preferred) form:

```bash
name () {
    commands
    return
}
```

where `name` is the name of the function and `commands` is a series of commands contained within the function.

Both forms are equivalent and may be used interchangeably. The following is a script that demonstrates the use of a shell function:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Shell function demo

function step2 {
    echo "Step 2"
    return
}

# Main program starts here

echo "Step 1"
step2
echo "Step 3"

```

**Note** that for function calls to be recognized as shell functions and not interpreted as the names of external programs, **shell function definitions** must appear in the script before they are called.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Program to output a system information

TITLE="System Information Report For $HOSTNAME"
CURRENT_TIME="$(date +"%x %r %Z")"
TIMESTAMP="Generated $CURRENT_TIME, by $USER"

report_uptime () {
    return
}

report_disk_space () {
    return
}

report_home_space () {
    return
}

cat << _EOF_
<html>
    <head>
        <title>$TITLE</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>$TITLE</h1>
        <p>$TIMESTAMP</p>
        $(report_uptime)
        $(report_disk_space)
        $(report_home_space)
    </body>
</html>
_EOF_

```

A function must contain at least one command. The `return` command (which is optional) satisfies the requirement.
