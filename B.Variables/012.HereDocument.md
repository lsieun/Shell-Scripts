# Here Document

A **here document** is an additional form of I/O redirection in which we embed a body of text into our script and feed it into the standard input of a command. It works like this:

```bash
command << token
text
token
```

where `command` is the name of command that accepts standard input and `token` is a string used to indicate the end of the embedded text. Here weâ€™ll modify our script to use a here document:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Program to output a system information

TITLE="System Information Report For $HOSTNAME"
CURRENT_TIME="$(date +"%x %r %Z")"
TIMESTAMP="Generated $CURRENT_TIME, by $USER"

cat << _EOF_
<html>
    <head>
        <title>$TITLE</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>$TITLE</h1>
        <p>$TIMESTAMP</p>
    </body>
</html>
_EOF_

```

Instead of using `echo`, our script now uses `cat` and a **here document**. The string `_EOF_` (meaning end of file, a common convention) was selected as the `token` and marks the end of the embedded text. **Note** that the `token` must appear alone and that there must not be trailing spaces on the line.
